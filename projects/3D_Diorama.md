<h1>3D1 Diorama</h1>

This diorama was created for the "3D 1" course, with instructions to design a small scene featuring a house and a signature large-scale vehicle.
I chose the theme "By The Ocean," drawing inspiration from my motherland, the Philippines.
The project involved gathering reference imagery to build and texture all assets from scratch in Blender.
It was a comprehensive exercise that taught me skills in 3D modeling and texture creation.
