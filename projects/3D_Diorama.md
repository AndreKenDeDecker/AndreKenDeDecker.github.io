<h1>3D1 Diorama</h1>

This is a diorama I made for the course "3D1" at DAE. We were instructed to make a small scene with a house and a big prop/vehicle of our choice.
The word I choose for the theme was "By The Ocean". I instantly thought of making a scene in my motherland, the Philippines. 
It was a lot of fun finding reference images and making the assets. I also learned a lot about making textures and assets in Blender.
