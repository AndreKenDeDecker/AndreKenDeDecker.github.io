> Sector 42 is an Unreal environments showcase. Made during the course "Environments 1" with some help from fellow students.

We had to make a sci-fi environment using only our own modular assets and textures. As the goal was to work smart and use our time efficiently.
We started out only with a block out and with the combination of feedback and multiple iterations. 
I ended up with Sector 42 as final result. As programmer I feel it was a worthwhile experience to work closely with artists and learn about their workflow.
