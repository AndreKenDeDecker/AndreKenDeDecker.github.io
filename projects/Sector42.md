> Sector 42 is an Unreal Sci-fi environments showcase. It's made with only custom modular assets and materials/textures.

For the "Environments 1" course, we were tasked with creating a sci-fi environment using exclusively custom-made modular assets and textures.
The primary goal of this project was to learn how to work smart and efficient within a production pipeline.
Starting with a basic blockout, the environment evolved through multiple iterations with the help of continuous feedback.
As a programmer, this project was a great opportunity to collaborate closely with artists and understanding their workflow.
