> Shield Arise is a top down action game where you play as a shield bearer. Try to survive as long as you can inside the infinite arena.
> So harness your parrying skills to swiftly defeat your enemies as they are stunned by your power!

For the "Game Engine Fundamentals" course at DAE, I developed a game in Unity based on two assigned keywords: "Shield" and "Arise".
Although I had experimented with Unity before, this was my first opportunity to create a complete game from start to finish.
My initial concept involved an explorable map, but I soon realized I had overscoped.
I then shifted my focus to the core gameplay loop finishing the combat and parrying mechanics
It was a fun experience and I learned a lot about working with Unity and C#.

## Game Mechanics

- **Parrying combat**

During combat the player can block any attack with their shield. When the player blocks just about when the enemy attack is about to hit they parry them. 
With parrying you can stun enemies with melee attacks and deflect incoming arrows. Stunned enemies can't do anything and are weaker to attacks.


- **3 different types of enemies**

Basic melee enemy: They are the most common enemy type you'll fight in the arena. They are weak and slow, but are dangerous in numbers.

Aggressive melee enemy: This enemy type will attack a lot more compared to the basic type. They will try to overwhelm the player with attacks, parrying them is the way to go.

Archer enemy: They will shoot from a distance, but are easily killed. Parry their arrows to use it against themselves.
