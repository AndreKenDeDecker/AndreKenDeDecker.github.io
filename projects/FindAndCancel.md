> Find & Cancel is a first-person bomb defusing game. The player has to find active bombs and defuse them all before the time runs out. 
> The game was made in Unreal Engine 5 for the course "game engine fundamentals" at DAE.
> We got two keywords to work with and we had to make a game based on those words. Mine were "Find" and "Cancel/Destroy".

## Game Mechanics

- Two unique bombs with different ways to defuse them.

Code bomb: This bomb has to be defused by inputting the correct code. The codes for the bombs can be found on terminals spread around the world.

Minigame bomb: The player has to play a game of "Simon Says" for this bomb to be defused. A random sequence of buttons will be played and the player has to copy it.

- Dynamic difficulty/map

The positions and amount of bombs placed into the map are modifiable by the player. Letting the players choose how hard they want the game to be.
