> SacriFetus is a co-op, hack-n-slash game about 2 cultist who want to summon their god by sacrificing babies.

The game was made in Unreal Engine 5 for the course "group projects" at DAE.
We were tasked to work on this game the whole semester, but we were limited to the time we had due to other courses.
Everyone was expected to work 10 hours per week on the game. Leading to a total of about 110 hours per person.
At the end it was a showcase of team effort and we ultimately won 2nd place for art style.

## My Contributions

I was in a team of 5 members working as a programmer mostly tasked with the gameplay and implementing the character sprites.  

- I was responsible for the player movement and combat.
- I made the enemy AI using Finite State Machine with states such as Wandering, Patrolling and Seeking.
- I also implemented the character sprite sheets that the artists have made and set up the logic for playing the correct animations.
