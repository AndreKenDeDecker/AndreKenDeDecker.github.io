## My Contributions

I was in a team of 5 members working as a programmer mostly tasked with the gameplay and implementing the character sprites.  

- I was responsible for the player movement and combat.
- I made the enemy AI using Finite State Machine with states such as Wandering, Patrolling and Seeking.
- I also implemented the character sprite sheets that the artists have made and set up the logic for playing the correct animations.
